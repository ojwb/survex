* Covariance matrices are symmetric - now only store 6 of the 9 entries.
  Reduces memory requirements and may be faster.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease7:

* Messages relating to command line options are now translatable.

* (MS DOS versions): now supply self-extracting zip archives.

* (MS Windows version): after running cavern, wait for a key press
  before closing the window.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease6:

* (MS Windows version): aven: if there are problems opening the
  message file, report them in a message box rather than printing text
  which the user will never see.

* cavern: invalid data lines weren't being counted, so you'd get
  incorrect line numbers reported for further errors and warnings.

* cavern: Added a SPLAY flag for indicating splay shots in chambers
  and large passages.

* extend: ignore surface legs and splay legs; preserve duplicate flag
  on extended legs.

* print*: if surface data isn't being plotted, ignore surface survey
  stations too, and select page layout based on underground data only.

* (MS Windows version): get default language from Windows.

* cavern: added *entrance command for indicating cave entrances.

* Added "surface", "underground", "exported", "fixed", and "entrance"
  station flags to 3d format.

* (DOS version): caverot: fixed bug Brian Clipstone reported where
  caverot would lock up when trying to plot a label off-screen.

* xcaverot/caverot: tweaked sense of a few controls to be consistent
  with each other and with aven.

* Strip leading '\' from station names read from old .3d files.

* cavern: Better reporting of error stats involving a station fixed
  with errors.

* aven: allow highlighting of fixed, exported, and entrance stations.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease5:

* survex: conversion wrapper now only creates __svxtmp.svx file if it
  has to - simple cases (such as "survex example.svx") don't need one;
  also always print warning that user should be using cavern instead.

* Minor updates to documentation.

* Survey stations names are no longer displayed with a leading '\' -
  this doesn't make sense now that root is deprecated, and didn't make
  much sense before to be honest.

* cavern: *fix with two standard deviations (horizontal and vertical)
  was being rejected - fixed.

* cavern: Fixed bug with station "\" appearing in the .err file for
  a station fixed with error estimates.

* (non-Unix versions): remove path and extension and lower-case program
  name for use in error reporting.

* (MS Windows version): added documentation overview page to HTML
  help.

* Removed 255 character limit on station names in .3d and .3dx files.

* caverot: overlapping label code wasn't allowing enough for vertical
  overlap.

* cavern: after a bad *data command, ignore survey data until the next
  valid *data command.

* printdm/printpcl: exit cleanly if bitmap font file is missing.

* cavern: give a more helpful error on empty "*export" or "*prefix".

* xcaverot: Fixed display of surface legs and related minor issues.

* print*: Fixed handling of surface legs; `-S' now recognised as a
  short-form for `--surface'.

* Added test of *solve command.

* cavern: Added commands *date, *team, *instrument, *copyright -
  currently these are ignored, but they provide a place to put data
  when importing/exporting, and will be processed in future versions.

* (MS Windows version): aven updated to same codebase as Unix version.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease4:

* Updated Portuguese and German translations.

* aven: Accents now work in display; suppress "wxstd" warning box for
  English; speed improvements; redesign of indicators; rescale by
  dragging scalebar; allow surface legs to be hidden (they are by
  default); now defaults to plan view; depth bar labelling improved;
  added caverot-like handling of flat surveys (so output from extend
  is locked flat).

* cavern: Complain if the same name is used for a survey and a station.

* cavern: Added --warnings-are-errors command line option.

* caverot/xcaverot: Middle button now tilts cave by dragging rather
  than toggling plan/elevation.

* caverot: continue setup in background while help page is displayed;
  "R" (Reverse Rotation) now only affects the auto-rotation - it used
  to affect "C", "V", "/", and "'".

* cavern: unused fix point warnings now work for stations fixed with
  error estimates; added test cases for this.

* testsuite: Enhanced many existing tests to check for warnings.

* Fixed to build on Solaris with Sun's compiler.

* Minor corrections to documentation and man pages.

* cavern: report *export errors at the file and line where the *begin
  for the survey involved was as that's much more useful.

* cavern: allow "-" in station names by default.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease3:

* (Unix version): aven: Internationalised; Fixed serious drawing bug
  causing incorrect rendering and segfaults; Scale bar now draggable;
  Depth bar tidied up; Orientation menu changes; Menu accelerators
  fixed; Status bar disabled (various continuing problems and it
  doesn't really convey much useful info anyway); About box fixes;
  Fixed crashes on mouse actions when no survey loaded; Improved
  labelling of scale bar and indicators.

* Created Swiss German and "German German" sub-versions of German
  translation.

* (DOS version): caverot: fixed slight underallocation of memory which
  probably caused the bug Brian Clipstone reported.

* cavern: Improved reporting of missing *export-s; added 2 more
  *export tests.

* No longer trap SIGINT (Ctrl-C) or SIGTERM (Ctrl-\ on Unix) as we
  can't do anything useful.

* Removed support for really old language names ("fren", "germ",
  "ital", etc) - use "fr", "de", "it", etc instead.

* (RISC OS version): support a few extra accents in messages.

* "Syntax" in command-line help messages now translated.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease2:

* cad3d: Fixed output from `--help'; -e, -D, -S short options now work;
  fixed infinite loop bug.

* (Unix version): aven: leaving "about" box no longer causes segfault;
  toggle status bar now works; N/S/E/W selects view rather than moving
  cave; window close now works; now have ticks on appropriate menu
  items; fixed problems with rendering (some legs missing!); 3d file
  specified on command line now loaded; fixed occasional hangs; fixed
  terrible slowness during rotation; implemented indicators; various
  other bugs fixed.

* Updated translations: pt de it (and fr partially)

* Added tests for most commands and various other cases.

* cavern: fixed *case (correct args are PRESERVE/TOUPPER/TOLOWER) and
  upper/lower were swapped.

* Documentation brought more up-to-date.

* caverot/xcaverot: fix missing end of list marker for surface data
  which typically resulted in a few extra bogus surface legs appearing.

* printer drivers: fixed .ini file reading routine (bug introduced in
  0.97-prerelease 1).

* printps: postscript file meta information now includes the date of
  creation, and also the name of the user running printps (Unix only).

* printer drivers: improved reporting of problems with print.ini files.

* (MSDOS version): fallback DPMI provider and floating point emulator
  were missing in 0.97-prerelease1.

* Better internationalisation - select localised system messages using
  setlocale().

Changes in 0.97-prerelease1:

* extend: fixed bug which resulted in bogus output (added regression test);
  produce binary rather than ASCII .3d output.

* cavern: don't report error stats for articulating traverses.

* (UNIX version): `make uninstall' now removes the HTML documentation.

* (UNIX version): printer drivers: Look for /etc/survex/print.ini rather
  than $SURVEXHOME/myprint.ini

* cavern: added warning that use of ROOT character ('\' by default) is
  deprecated; updated documentation to mention this.

* cavern: added *export command to allow scope of station names to be
  limited.  If *export is never used, behaviour is as before.

* cavern: added *flags command to allow surface surveys and duplicate
  surveys (to be ignored when calculating the total survey length) to be
  indicated.

* new version of 3d file format which can store flags and is slightly more
  compact.  NB New programs can load old .3d files, but old programs can't
  load new .3d files.

* caverot/xcaverot: allow surface legs to be hidden (they are by default)

* cavern: compass can be omitted on legs in diving data to indicate a plumbed
  leg.  In this case the tape and depth gauge readings are combined to give
  the length of the leg.

* cavern: *begin/*prefix reentry warning now gives the original location as
  a separate warning so smart editors will allow you to click on it to jump
  to that file and line.

* printer drivers: put "http://www.survex.com/" on printouts in case someone
  who gets a printout wants to know more about Survex.

* cavern: added easting, northing, altitude added as prefered aliases for
  dx, dy, dz.

* cavern: bug fix: "*prefix \" or "*begin \" would cause an internal error.

* xcaverot: "load" button now works; bearing always shown in range 0-360;
  / and ' now tilt cave; `u' and `d' now switch to view from above/below;
  shift-ed keys now work; `o' now turns off non-overlapping labels;
  `ctrl-L' toggles display of survey legs.

* caverot: n/s/e/w/u/d now work as in xcaverot - the previous functions they
  had weren't actually useful; if memory is really tight, disable
  non-overlapping labels rather than dying with an error.

* prefer balanced quotes (`...') to unbalanced ('...') in messages.

* cavern: file reading errors now treated as fatal; unattached survey error
  now fatal.

* survex: syntax errors in command line arguments now fatal.

* cavern: if there are errors, don't produce output files.

* cavern: bug fix: trying to report certain errors in really long lines could
  cause an internal error.

* 3dtodxf: renamed to cad3d since it can now produce DXF or sketch format.

* aven: rewritten to use wxwindows (under Unix only so far).

* printwin: new native Microsoft Windows printer driver.

* (MS Windows version): new installation wizard.

* Use double precision floating point to pass numbers to/from .3d file
  reading rotuines to avoid rounding problems.

* cavern: change of terminology - use "reading" instead of "datum",
  since datum more usually means a map datum in surveying.

Changes in 0.96:

* (MSDOS and MS Windows versions): fixed bug in message file handling
  introduced in 0.96-prerelease 1 - symptoms: messages incorrectly looked
  for in current directory, or just printing "???" and exiting.

* cavern: attempting to *include a non-existant file used to complain:
  "In file included from example.svx:31:" / "cavern: Couldn't open data file
  'bad.svx'" - now complain "example.svx:31: Couldn't open data file
  'bad.svx'".

* xcaverot: cursor keys now move the 3D centre of rotation rather than just
  the position of the survey in the window.

Changes in 0.96-prerelease4:

* cavern (RISC OS version): "is this a directory" test would never say
  "yes".

* caverot: (MSDOS version) cursor keys and delete had stopped working (due
  to changes in allegro graphics library) - fixed.

* xcaverot: Zoom in and out with keyboard now behaves exactly like clicking
  on buttons; Removed unused "select" button; Fixed significant memory leak.

* aven: (MS Windows version) Mark Shinwell has written a Microsoft Windows
  version of aven, which is better in almost every way than the directx
  version of caverot (and we're working to fix the few shortfalls), so we've
  shelved directx caverot and are now including aven instead with the MS
  Windows version.

Changes in 0.96-prerelease3:

* caverot: DirectX version for Microsoft Windows.

* caverot: (MSDOS version) 640x480 doesn't work under NT either, but 320x200
  does so default to that instead.

* caverot: --mode-picker option now listed by --help.

Changes in 0.96-prerelease2:

* caverot: (MSDOS version) --mode-picker now recognised anywhere on command
  line (had to be last previously).

* caverot: (MSDOS version) messages from Allegro library now
  internationalised.

* caverot: (MSDOS version) don't try to get 800x600 if running under NT -
  try 640x480 instead.

Changes in 0.96-prerelease1:

* xcaverot: Improved responsiveness; can now load multiple .3d files from
  command line; set defaults (press DELETE) now defaults scale that which
  fits the whole survey on the screen.

* cavern: Fixed bug in DOS and Windows versions with handling of paths
  containing a mixture of "/" and "\".

* 3dtodxf: added "--grid" option (supplied by Leandro); output file now
  defaults to same name as input file but with a ".dxf" extension.

* caverot: now get accents with MSDOS version.

* cavern: applied patch from Leandro to fix problem with diving and topofil
  styles.

* 3dtodxf: can now produce an elevation view with --elevation=ANGLE option.

Changes in 0.95:

* Put aven in a separate RPM package since it depends on a stack of
  libraries which not everyone will want to have to install.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease7:

* Disabled experimental gross-error detection code.

* Now build RPMs (for RedHat Linux - may also work with Mandrake and some
  others).

Changes in 0.95-prerelease6:

* Updated all translations.

* Fixed another logic error in "only mentioned once in *equate with explicit
  prefix" check.

* Minor fixes to get MSDOS (djgpp) and MS Windows (mingw) builds working.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease5:

* If no stations are fixed, the first station mentioned is supposed to be.
  But on some platforms (e.g. x86 Linux) the second station was being used
  instead (regression test firststn).

Changes in 0.95-prerelease4:

* Fixed typo which prevented documentation from installing.

* Fixed logic error in "only mentioned once in *equate with explicit prefix"
  check.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease3:

* aven: updated to compile with new cvrotimg.

* More fixes for compilation problems on non-Linux UNIX platforms.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease2:

* Minor tweaks to some messages.

* 3dtodxf: Fixed calculation of bounding box if all coordinates are negative
  in one or more axes.

  point to the HTML documentation.

* Fixes for compilation problems on non-Linux UNIX platforms.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease1:

* cavern: *fix with error values (one for same all round, two for horizontal
  and vertical, three for x, y, z)

  with multiple fixed points); added regression test

* cavern: "*begin" / "*end foo" now gives more explicit error

* cavern: More work on gross error detection

* xcaverot: you can now set environmental variables XCAVEROT_FONTNAME,
  XCAVEROT_INDICATOR_RADIUS

* extend: now starts from highest station with only one leg.  If no such
  station exists then revert to the previous behaviour of starting from
  the highest station (but complain if we have no legs at all).

* cavern: line numbers now correct for .svx files with Mac style lineends

* cavern: improved error reporting in several cases

* caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
  bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks

* cavern: added data styles "TOPOFIL" (like tape/compass/clino but with a
  counter instead of the tape), "CARTESIAN" (dx, dy, dz), and "NOSURVEY"
  (for unsurveyed connections between surveys)

* cavern: can now suppress "unused fixed point" error on a station by
  station basis by using: "*fix <station> reference <coords>"

* cavern: new command "*require <version>" to allow survey data to specify
  the minimum survex version required to process it

* print*: now search multiple print.ini files so you can override settings
  in the shipped file rather than having to modify it.  Search order is:
  ~/.survex/print.ini (unix only), $SURVEXHOME/myprint.ini,
  $SURVEXHOME/print.ini

* Changed xcaverot rotation/zoom to be the same way round as caverot

* diffpos, extend, xcaverot, caverot: Now use cmdline library to parse
  command line arguments and so support --help, --version, etc.

* hto2svx, svx2hto, and survex wrapper now all support --help and --version

* `configure --disable-aven' now disables building of aven

* caverot: on RISC OS fall back to using 2 or just 1 screen bank if there's
  not enough video memory allocated for 3.

* Documentation brought more up to date.

* If a station is only referenced once, and that reference is in a *equate
  and with an explicit prefix (e.g. "*equate 1 possibletypo.6"), a warning
  is issued.

Changes in 0.94-prerelease2:

* Added test for "cavern would segfault in articulate() on second *solve"
  (bug3.svx)

Changes in 0.94-prerelease1:

* cavern: Fix for bug reported by Leandro - cavern would segfault in
  articulate() on second *solve

* xcaverot: Applied patches from Leandro: fix menu buttons, keyboard
  shortcuts, colour of station markers, scalebar length and text display,
  mouse right-button "cave drag", centre-button "plan/elevation switch",
  zoom in/out menu button

* cavern: Fixed "matrix wouldn't invert" problem with certain datasets;
  added regression test (bug2)

* Check for sgmltools v3 (sgmltools-lite) as well as v2

* BorlandC and RISC OS config files are now regenerated when version number
  is updated

Changes in 0.93:

* Quick fix for problem with finding articulation points in particularly
  contorted components with 2 or more fixed points - for now each component
  is solved separately, but they aren't split at articulation points

* Turned off some debug code left active by mistake

* Test suite was missing a file

Changes in 0.92:

* 3dtodxf's DXF output can be opened by AutoCAD 13, 14 and 2000, as
  well as ArcView 3.x. Adobe Illustrator 8.0, and CorelDraw 8.
  [checked by Mike Yocum]

* HTML documentation now has meaningful filenames (no more "x532.htm")

* RISC OS documentation zip file now has correct filetype for
  Postscript version of docs

* RISC OS binary distribution now includes !CLIcon GUI front end

  operating system with sensible defaults in print.ini

* print.ini: major overhaul of layout to improve readability

* Another regression test case added

* HACKING: new file containing nuggets of wisdom for developers

* Added default s.d. for level legs

* Catch *begin and matching *end in different files

* Updated Portuguese, French, and German translations [Leandro/Eric/Gerhard]

* Wrong warning was being given for `*equate 1 1'

* print.ini: Tidied up comments about font size and line width for
  printps

* printps: Line width now set correctly for all pages with ghostview

* cavern: Fixed problem with highly *equate-d nodes (introduced in
  0.92-pre1)

* aven: Fixed redraw errors; enabled splash screen [mark]

* cavern: Fixed deltastar network transformation to handle covariances

* More test cases added to catch any regressions of recent bug fixes

* Include alien.pl in distibution (helper script for compiling with
  BorlandC and on RISC OS)

* cavern: tests for zero now use epsilon related tests, apart for on
  RISC OS where the FP emulation appears to cut corners and give
  slightly incorrect answers.

* Now include Postscript version of documentation

* HTML documentation now uses ".htm" extension instead of ".html" to
  placate crap unzip programs which can't handle anything over 8.3

* NEWS now describes user-visible changes; ChangeLog is now
  autogenerated from the CVS commit messages

Changes in 0.92-prerelease3:

* xcaverot: Switching between plan and elevation now smoother

* xcaverot: Fixed poor handling of keypresses when rotating

* xcaverot: Reenabled buttons and made plan/elev button work properly

* aven: New experimental gtk-based xcaverot replacement

Changes in 0.92-prerelease2:

* Can now just run individual tests from test suite

* Improved various bits of debug code

* cavern: Fixed minor problems when compiling with NO_COVARIANCES

* In test suite, cavern failing now causes test to fail immediately

* Include riscos/config.h.in and borlandc/config.h.in in distribution

* cavern: Fixed bug when finding articulation points in a component
  with more than one fixed point

Changes in 0.92-prerelease1:

* caverot: Help screen incorrectly documented tilt as '/' and ':' -
  actually it's on '/' and ''' (single quote)

* caverot: Previously assumed shift-singlequote is '@' which is true
  on UK keyboards but not on US keyboards.  Quick fix: check both '@'
  and '"' for now.

* "printps -b" now reports "option requires an argument" (used to segfault)

* Updated printer driver command line options in manual

* caverot: Fixed shift key to accelerate movements in allegro version

* cavern: Disabled articulation point code (for now - there's a bug)

* cavern: If a datafile isn't found, now try a lowercase version
  before giving up (so on Unix you can now process a DOS dataset by
  unpacking with "unzip -L" to force filenames of unpacked files to
  lower case)

* diffpos: Fixed a couple of bugs; also now exits with status 1 if
  differences were reported

* Added some tests for cavern and diffpos - more to follow

* cavern: Covariance code now working and enabled by default

* cavern: When equating two existing stations we need to replace the
  pos of one with the pos of the other.  We used to look down the
  whole station list, now we just look at neighbouring nodes
  (noticable time saving for large networks with many equates)

* cavern: Renamed truncate function in commands.c to avoid clash with
  library truncate function on FreeBSD

* cavern: Warn that *prefix and *default are deprecated

* Fixed obscure problems when configure is rerun with a different prefix

* If the environmental variable SURVEXLANG isn't set, LANG is now
  check before resorting to the default.  LANG is a standard way to
  specify the language for GNU applications - SURVEXLANG is still
  useful as a way to specify an alternate language if Survex doesn't
  support your prefered language.

* Cured superfluous copy of svxdocs in doc/svxdocs in source distribution

* RISC OS and BorlandC builds now track copyright message and version
  number automatically

* If LANG is set to "en_US", treat it as if it were "en-us"

* xcaverot: Merged in changes from John Pybus and Mark Shinwell

* cavern: *solve followed by some entirely unconnected survey now
  caught cleanly (used to hit an assert)

* cavern: Corrected component and loop counts when there's hanging
  survey around

Changes in 0.91:

* Fixed problem with message files with accented characters

* Fixed RISC OS specific problem if SURVEXLANG was set

* xcaverot: Fixed to centre and scale cave on startup

* Removed superfluous containing directory for RISC OS documentation

Changes in 0.90:

* caverot: MSDOS Allegro mode-picker now reappears if an invalid mode
  is chosen (caverot used to unhelpfully exit in this case).

* caverot: Fixed cursor keys and delete in MSDOS Allegro version

* fixed problem with US English messages

* text files in DOS/Win32 zips now have ".txt" extension and DOS
  end-of-lines

  DXF output

* caverot: Right and Middle mouse button functions were swapped under
  RISC OS

* caverot: BorlandC (pre-386) version wasn't erasing screen between redraws

* HTML version of documentation now has a hyperlinked table of
  contents

Changes in 0.90 beta3:

* cavern: output files now go in current directory rather than the
  same directory where the first .svx file is found.  You can set a
  different directory using the "--output" command line option, which
  can point to a directory or a file.

* cavern: "*truncate off" rather than "*truncate 0"

* survex: added wrapper to convert survex invocation into cavern invocation

* hto filters moved into separate subdirectory of source distribution

* cavern: fixed bug which included stations with 4 or more connections
  in the .3d file several times

* added "miniam.pl" which generates makefiles for BorlandC and RISC OS

* printdm/printpcl: weren't showing text - problem with new format
  font file

* check for old SURVEXLANG codes (engi, fren, germ, ...) now case
  insensitive

Changes in 0.90 beta2:

* xcaverot: Fixed to handle > 2048 stations/legs

* Spanish and Catalan translations updated (only French left to do)

Changes in 0.90 beta1:

* German, Italian, and Portuguese translations updated

* Documentation brought largely up to date

In 0.90 alpha5:

* cavern: comment parsing fix

* cavern: network reduction bug fixed

* new messages extracted for translation

* printps: much smaller postscript output

* printps: real circles in postscript output

* nicer infobox on printouts

* caverot: help page improved

* scale units on printout bug fixed

In 0.90 alpha4:

* printps: made postscript bounding box slightly larger

* printps: tweaked postscript output to reduce size (5% smaller for
  Kaninchenhoehle)

In 0.90 alpha3:

* fixed bogus "Error writing printer output" message from printer drivers

* minor cosmetic fixes to printer drivers

* printps: added postscript bounding box

* printps: fixed extra "%"s in postscript output

* cavern: removed stray debug messages added in 0.90 alpha2

In 0.90 alpha2:

* cavern: fixed memory allocation bug (affected *include and *title)

In 0.90 alpha1:

* cavern: Halt after 50 errors to save swamping user

* now use GNU getopt to parse command line options

* cavern: -f and @ removed

* cavern: -n, -t and -u replaced by *-commands

* source code tidied up considerably

* new format message files - now internally use unicode (in UTF-8) and
  should be faster and smaller

* new format font file for printdm/printpcl (faster and smaller)

* cavern: GCC format error/warning messages to allow clicking on
  messages to jump to the problem line in editors which support it
  (e.g. GNU emacs and jed)

* Now uses GNU automake under Unix which makes my life a lot easier and also
  provides "make install"

* xcaverot: now checks for failing to open the X display

Changes in 0.81:

* survex: Network reduction bug fixed (fix carried back from 0.90 development)

Changes in 0.80:

* Added ChangeLog

* DOS binary distribution now includes files: BUGS NEWS TODO ChangeLog

* Cross-compiler build for DOS now has strips debugging information
  from .exe files once more, so they are rather smaller

* Sources now include configure.in for those wanting to do major development
  work

* Unix versions now build use GNU autoconf - to build just unpack, run
  "./configure" then "make"

* Messages file now represents accents like in HTML (e.g. &eacute;
  for é)

* caverot: fixed up standard DOS (allegro) version to work much
  better.  In particular, it will now try to choose a video mode for
  itself (use --mode-picker at the end of the command line to get the
  mode picker), and keyboard and mouse initialisation problems are
  cured

* survex: You can now use DOS or UNIX style filenames (/ or \ for
  directory separator) on any platform and they will be translated to
  the native format for your OS.  This makes datasets much more
  portable.

* survex: "Unique" option changed to "Truncate" and now truncates
  names if set

* Removed artificial limit on survey station name length (was 12
  characters per prefix component)

* Many other minor changes
