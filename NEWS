* Updated all translations.

* Fixed another logic error in "only mentioned once in *equate with explicit
  prefix" check.

* Minor fixes to get MSDOS (djgpp) and MS Windows (mingw) builds working.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease5:

* If no stations are fixed, the first station mentioned is supposed to be.
  But on some platforms (e.g. x86 Linux) the second station was being used
  instead (regression test firststn).

Changes in 0.95-prerelease4:

* Fixed typo which prevented documentation from installing.

* Fixed logic error in "only mentioned once in *equate with explicit prefix"
  check.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease3:

* aven: updated to compile with new cvrotimg.

* More fixes for compilation problems on non-Linux UNIX platforms.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease2:

* Minor tweaks to some messages.

* 3dtodxf: Fixed calculation of bounding box if all coordinates are negative
  in one or more axes.

* Added Wookey's man pages - these just list the command line options and
  point to the HTML documentation.

* Fixes for compilation problems on non-Linux UNIX platforms.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease1:

* cavern: *fix with error values (one for same all round, two for horizontal
  and vertical, three for x, y, z)

* Fixed RISC OS not treating "foo." as a directory

* Improved behaviour when sgmltools not installed

* cavern: Merged patches for generating .3dx files for chasm

* Miscellaneous code tidying

* Moved unresolvable issues from BUGS to ZOMBIES

* cavern: Fixed articulation code bug (handling of some cases of components
  with multiple fixed points); added regression test

* cavern: "*begin" / "*end foo" now gives more explicit error

* cavern: More work on gross error detection

* xcaverot: you can now set environmental variables XCAVEROT_FONTNAME,
  XCAVEROT_INDICATOR_RADIUS

* extend: now starts from highest station with only one leg.  If no such
  station exists then revert to the previous behaviour of starting from
  the highest station (but complain if we have no legs at all).

* cavern: line numbers now correct for .svx files with Mac style lineends

* cavern: improved error reporting in several cases

* caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
  bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
  to test this works]

* cavern: added data styles "TOPOFIL" (like tape/compass/clino but with a
  counter instead of the tape), "CARTESIAN" (dx, dy, dz), and "NOSURVEY"
  (for unsurveyed connections between surveys)

* cavern: can now suppress "unused fixed point" error on a station by
  station basis by using: "*fix <station> reference <coords>"

* cavern: new command "*require <version>" to allow survey data to specify
  the minimum survex version required to process it

* print*: now search multiple print.ini files so you can override settings
  in the shipped file rather than having to modify it.  Search order is:
  ~/.survex/print.ini (unix only), $SURVEXHOME/myprint.ini,
  $SURVEXHOME/print.ini

* Changed xcaverot rotation/zoom to be the same way round as caverot

* diffpos, extend, xcaverot, caverot: Now use cmdline library to parse
  command line arguments and so support --help, --version, etc.

* hto2svx, svx2hto, and survex wrapper now all support --help and --version

* `configure --disable-aven' now disables building of aven

* caverot: on RISC OS fall back to using 2 or just 1 screen bank if there's
  not enough video memory allocated for 3.

* Documentation brought more up to date.

* If a station is only referenced once, and that reference is in a *equate
  and with an explicit prefix (e.g. "*equate 1 possibletypo.6"), a warning
  is issued.

Changes in 0.94-prerelease2:

* Added test for "cavern would segfault in articulate() on second *solve"
  (bug3.svx)

Changes in 0.94-prerelease1:

* cavern: Fix for bug reported by Leandro - cavern would segfault in
  articulate() on second *solve

* xcaverot: Applied patches from Leandro: fix menu buttons, keyboard
  shortcuts, colour of station markers, scalebar length and text display,
  mouse right-button "cave drag", centre-button "plan/elevation switch",
  zoom in/out menu button

* cavern: Fixed "matrix wouldn't invert" problem with certain datasets;
  added regression test (bug2)

* BorlandC and RISC OS config files are now regenerated when version number
  is updated

Changes in 0.93:

  contorted components with 2 or more fixed points - for now each component
  is solved separately, but they aren't split at articulation points

* Turned off some debug code left active by mistake

* Test suite was missing a file

Changes in 0.92:

* 3dtodxf's DXF output can be opened by AutoCAD 13, 14 and 2000, as
  well as ArcView 3.x. Adobe Illustrator 8.0, and CorelDraw 8.
  [checked by Mike Yocum]

* HTML documentation now has meaningful filenames (no more "x532.htm")

* RISC OS documentation zip file now has correct filetype for
  Postscript version of docs

* RISC OS binary distribution now includes !CLIcon GUI front end

  operating system with sensible defaults in print.ini

* print.ini: major overhaul of layout to improve readability

* Another regression test case added

* HACKING: new file containing nuggets of wisdom for developers

* Added default s.d. for level legs

* Fixed network reduction bug (undoing network simplifications didn't
  always restore removed stations to the station list)

* Catch *begin with no matching *end

* Catch *begin and matching *end in different files

* Updated Portugese, French, and German translations [Leandro/Eric/Gerhard]

* Wrong warning was being given for `*equate 1 1'

  0.92-pre1)

* aven: Fixed redraw errors; enabled splash screen [mark]

* cavern: Fixed deltastar network transformation to handle covariances

* More test cases added to catch any regressions of recent bug fixes

* Include alien.pl in distibution (helper script for compiling with
  BorlandC and on RISC OS)

* cavern: tests for zero now use epsilon related tests, apart for on
  RISC OS where the FP emulation appears to cut corners and give
  slightly incorrect answers.

* Now include Postscript version of documentation

* HTML documentation now uses ".htm" extension instead of ".html" to
  placate crap unzip programs which can't handle anything over 8.3

* NEWS now describes user-visible changes; ChangeLog is now
  autogenerated from the CVS commit messages

Changes in 0.92-prerelease3:

* xcaverot: Switching between plan and elevation now smoother

* xcaverot: Fixed poor handling of keypresses when rotating

* xcaverot: Reenabled buttons and made plan/elev button work properly

* aven: New experimental gtk-based xcaverot replacement

Changes in 0.92-prerelease2:

* Can now just run individual tests from test suite

* cavern: Turned off stray debugging output in matrix.c

* Improved various bits of debug code

* cavern: Fixed minor problems when compiling with NO_COVARIANCES

* In test suite, cavern failing now causes test to fail immediately

* Include riscos/config.h.in and borlandc/config.h.in in distribution

* cavern: Fixed bug when finding articulation points in a component
  with more than one fixed point

Changes in 0.92-prerelease1:

* caverot: Help screen incorrectly documented tilt as '/' and ':' -
  actually it's on '/' and ''' (single quote)

* caverot: Previously assumed shift-singlequote is '@' which is true
  on UK keyboards but not on US keyboards.  Quick fix: check both '@'
  and '"' for now.

* "printps -b" now reports "option requires an argument" (used to segfault)

* Updated printer driver command line options in manual

* caverot: Fixed shift key to accelerate movements in allegro version

* cavern: Disabled articulation point code (for now - there's a bug)

* cavern: If a datafile isn't found, now try a lowercase version
  before giving up (so on Unix you can now process a DOS dataset by
  unpacking with "unzip -L" to force filenames of unpacked files to
  lower case)

* diffpos: Fixed a couple of bugs; also now exits with status 1 if
  differences were reported

* Added some tests for cavern and diffpos - more to follow

* cavern: Covariance code now working and enabled by default

* cavern: When equating two existing stations we need to replace the
  pos of one with the pos of the other.  We used to look down the
  whole station list, now we just look at neighbouring nodes
  (noticable time saving for large networks with many equates)

* cavern: Renamed truncate function in commands.c to avoid clash with
  library truncate function on FreeBSD

* cavern: Warn that *prefix and *default are deprecated

* Fixed obscure problems when configure is rerun with a different prefix

* If the environmental variable SURVEXLANG isn't set, LANG is now
  check before resorting to the default.  LANG is a standard way to
  specify the language for GNU applications - SURVEXLANG is still
  useful as a way to specify an alternate language if Survex doesn't
  support your prefered language.

* Cured superfluous copy of svxdocs in doc/svxdocs in source distribution

* RISC OS and BorlandC builds now track copyright message and version
  number automatically

* If LANG is set to "en_US", treat it as if it were "en-us"

* xcaverot: Merged in changes from John Pybus and Mark Shinwell

* cavern: *solve followed by some entirely unconnected survey now
  caught cleanly (used to hit an assert)

* cavern: Corrected component and loop counts when there's hanging
  survey around

Changes in 0.91:

* Fixed RISC OS specific problem if SURVEXLANG was set

* xcaverot: Fixed to centre and scale cave on startup

* Removed superfluous containing directory for RISC OS documentation

Changes in 0.90:

* caverot: MSDOS Allegro mode-picker now reappears if an invalid mode
  is chosen (caverot used to unhelpfully exit in this case).

* caverot: Fixed cursor keys and delete in MSDOS Allegro version

* fixed problem with US English messages

* text files in DOS/Win32 zips now have ".txt" extension and DOS
  end-of-lines

* 3dtodxf: Leandro Dybal Bertoni has made major improvements to
  DXF output

* caverot: Right and Middle mouse button functions were swapped under
  RISC OS

* caverot: BorlandC (pre-386) version wasn't erasing screen between redraws

* HTML version of documentation now has a hyperlinked table of
  contents

Changes in 0.90 beta3:

* cavern: output files now go in current directory rather than the
  same directory where the first .svx file is found.  You can set a
  different directory using the "--output" command line option, which
  can point to a directory or a file.

* cavern: "*truncate off" rather than "*truncate 0"

* survex: added wrapper to convert survex invocation into cavern invocation

* hto filters moved into separate subdirectory of source distribution

* cavern: fixed bug which included stations with 4 or more connections
  in the .3d file several times

* added "miniam.pl" which generates makefiles for BorlandC and RISC OS

* printdm/printpcl: weren't showing text - problem with new format
  font file

* check for old SURVEXLANG codes (engi, fren, germ, ...) now case
  insensitive

Changes in 0.90 beta2:

* xcaverot: Fixed to handle > 2048 stations/legs

* Spanish and Catalan translations updated (only French left to do)

* Documentation brought largely up to date

In 0.90 alpha5:

* cavern: comment parsing fix

* cavern: network reduction bug fixed

* new messages extracted for translation

* printps: much smaller postscript output

* printps: real circles in postscript output

* nicer infobox on printouts

* caverot: help page improved

* scale units on printout bug fixed

In 0.90 alpha4:

* printps: made postscript bounding box slightly larger

* printps: tweaked postscript output to reduce size (5% smaller for
  Kaninchenhoehle)

In 0.90 alpha3:

* fixed bogus "Error writing printer output" message from printer drivers

* minor cosmetic fixes to printer drivers

* printps: added postscript bounding box

* printps: fixed extra "%"s in postscript output

* cavern: removed stray debug messages added in 0.90 alpha2

In 0.90 alpha2:

* cavern: fixed memory allocation bug (affected *include and *title)

In 0.90 alpha1:

* cavern: Halt after 50 errors to save swamping user

* now use GNU getopt to parse command line options

* cavern: -f and @ removed

* cavern: -n, -t and -u replaced by *-commands

* source code tidied up considerably

* new format message files - now internally use unicode (in UTF-8) and
  should be faster and smaller

* new format font file for printdm/printpcl (faster and smaller)

* cavern: GCC format error/warning messages to allow clicking on
  messages to jump to the problem line in editors which support it
  (e.g. GNU emacs and jed)

* Now uses GNU automake under Unix which makes my life a lot easier and also
  provides "make install"

* xcaverot: now checks for failing to open the X display

Changes in 0.81:

* survex: Network reduction bug fixed (fix carried back from 0.90 development)

Changes in 0.80:

* Added ChangeLog

* DOS binary distribution now includes files: BUGS NEWS TODO ChangeLog

* Cross-compiler build for DOS now has strips debugging information
  from .exe files once more, so they are rather smaller

* Sources now include configure.in for those wanting to do major development
  work

* Unix versions now build use GNU autoconf - to build just unpack, run
  "./configure" then "make"

* Messages file now represents accents like in HTML (e.g. &eacute;
  for é)

* caverot: fixed up standard DOS (allegro) version to work much
  better.  In particular, it will now try to choose a video mode for
  itself (use --mode-picker at the end of the command line to get the
  mode picker), and keyboard and mouse initialisation problems are
  cured

* survex: You can now use DOS or UNIX style filenames (/ or \ for
  directory separator) on any platform and they will be translated to
  the native format for your OS.  This makes datasets much more
  portable.

* survex: "Unique" option changed to "Truncate" and now truncates
  names if set

* Removed artificial limit on survey station name length (was 12
  characters per prefix component)

* Many other minor changes
