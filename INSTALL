Installing Survex on Unix
=========================

If you are using Debian Linux or Ubuntu Linux or a distribution based
on one of these, you will find it easier to install one of the
prepackaged versions of Survex.

Otherwise building from source is very easy.  First of all, you need
to make sure you have the required libraries installed.  The main
dependency is wxWidgets 2.8 or later - if there's a suitable wxWidgets
package for your platform, then just use that (note: library packages
are usually split into runtime and development, usually with the same
name but with a -dev or -devel or similar suffix on the latter - you'll
need both to build Survex).

Otherwise download the source code from https://wxwidgets.org/ and
follow their build instructions.  IMPORTANT: You must enable OpenGL
support by adding --with-opengl to the configure command line, and
you probably want to use --enable-unicode too.

You'll also need a working C and C++ compiler (with support for C++11), and
also the OpenGL development libraries if these aren't pulled in by installing
wxWidgets.

Then at a shell prompt, enter the following commands:

./configure
make
make install

By default 'make install' will try to install Survex under /usr/local,
which means you'll probably need to become root for the 'make install' stage.
If you use sudo to manage root access, then:

sudo make install

You can tell configure to install Survex elsewhere (e.g. under your home
directory) like so:

./configure --prefix=/home/olly/survex
make
make install

If your wxWidgets installation isn't picked up automatically, or you
have more than one version installed and want to select a particular
one, then you can specify this like so:

./configure WX_CONFIG=/opt/bin/wx-config

You can use both --prefix and WX_CONFIG= if necessary.
