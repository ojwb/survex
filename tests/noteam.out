Survey contains 2 survey stations, joined by 1 leg.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    0.52m (   0.52m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    0.52m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.02m
Vertical range = 0.02m (from GX1 at 0.00m to GX2 at -0.02m)
North-South range = 0.51m (from GX2 at 0.51m to GX1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 0.10m (from GX2 at 0.10m to GX1 at 0.00m)
