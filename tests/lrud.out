Survey contains 5 survey stations, joined by 4 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =   39.31m (  39.31m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =   38.72m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    6.55m
Vertical range = 6.55m (from AA1 at 0.00m to AA5 at -6.55m)
North-South range = 24.79m (from AA5 at 24.79m to AA1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 29.60m (from AA5 at 29.60m to AA1 at 0.00m)
