Survey contains 4 survey stations, joined by 3 legs.
Total length of survey legs =    1.00m (   1.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    1.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from b at 0.00m to b at 0.00m)
North-South range = 1.00m (from b at 1.00m to a at 0.00m)
East-West range = 0.00m (from b at 0.00m to b at 0.00m)
