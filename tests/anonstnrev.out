Survey contains 2 survey stations, joined by 1 leg.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    0.00m (   0.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    0.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from anonymous station at 0.00m to anonymous station at 0.00m)
Vertical range = 0.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 2.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to anonymous station at -2.00m)
North-South range = 0.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 0.00m (from anonymous station at 0.00m to anonymous station at 0.00m)
East-West range = 0.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
   2 1-nodes.
