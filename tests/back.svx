; Regression test for bug fixed in 1.2.25.  In versions prior to this, this
; would incorrectly warn about the difference between COMPASS and BACKCOMPASS,
; as we were using 0 for the BACKCOMPASS s.d. which leads to a threshold of
; about 71% of what it should be:
1 R 10 001.178 198.822 -1.178 -1.178
