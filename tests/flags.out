Survey contains 8 survey stations, joined by 8 legs.
There is 1 loop.
Total length of survey legs =    1.30m (   1.25m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    1.30m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from y at 0.00m to y at 0.00m)
North-South range = 3.00m (from y at 3.00m to C1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 0.10m (from C5 at 0.10m to y at 0.00m)

There were 1 warning(s).
