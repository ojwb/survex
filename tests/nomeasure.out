Survey contains 4 survey stations, joined by 3 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    4.00m (   4.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    4.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from C4 at 0.00m to C4 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 6.00m (from C4 at 6.00m to C1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 0.00m (from C4 at 0.00m to C4 at 0.00m)
