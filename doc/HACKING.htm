<H1>Hacking Survex</H1>

<p>(That's hacking in the "tinkering with code" sense, not in the
"breaking into other people's computer systems" sense).

<p>This is currently a random collection of notes that need to be written
down while I remember.  With time it should evolve into a more
coherent document.  If you have any questions which this should answer
but doesn't then ask me and I'll add them.

<H2>Network code debugging</H2>

<P>You can pick which network simplifications are attempted using "-z"
with an argument listing code letters.  So:

<ul>
<li>-z=    no special simplifications (articulation still performed)
<li>-z=l   remove "lollipops"
<li>-z=p   remove parallel legs
<li>-z=d   convert deltas to stars
</ul>

<P>And you can combine these in any combination:

<ul>
<li>-z=lp  remove "lollipops" and parallel legs
<li>-z=lpd remove "lollipops" and parallel legs; convert deltas to stars
</ul>

<P>"-z=lpd" is the default (in 0.99 at least - more transformations may
conceivably be added in future, although the simple common cases are
already covered).

<H2>Developing on Unix Platforms</H2>

<P>You'll need automake 1.5 or later (earlier versions don't support
per-executable CFLAGS; 1.6 has been tested and works, but wasn't a
very stable release - automake 1.6.1 is a better bet)
and autoconf 2.50 or later (autoconf 2.52, 2.53, 2.64 and 2.71 have all
been used successfully).

<p>The wxWidgets library is used for aven's UI.  Currently &gt;= 3.0.0 is
supported.

<p>The PROJ library is used for coordinate conversions.  Currently &gt;= 6.2.0 is
supported.

<P>The Perl Locale::PO module is used for process message translation files.

<P>For building the documentation you'll need sphinx-doc (Debian/Ubuntu package
<tt>python3-sphinx</tt>) and w3m.

<P>And for building unifont.pixelfont, you'll need unifont installed.

<P>On Debian, you can install the required packages using:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake liblocale-po-perl libproj-dev libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev inkscape netpbm python3-sphinx w3m unifont
</pre>

<H2>Building on Non-Unix Platforms</H2>

<H3>Mingw (Microsoft Windows)</H3>

<p>Survex can be built in an MSYS2+mingw64 environment - since 1.4.9 the
pre-built installer for Microsoft Windows is built in such an environment
by a CI job running on Github Actions.
</p>

<p>
It should also be possible to use a Linux-hosted cross-compiler, which is
how we used to built releases, but this requires cross-building a lot of
required libraries so we gave up on doing this.  Some notes on this are
left below in case anyone wants to try.
</p>

<p>
I use the packaged cross-compiler in the debian testing/unstable distribution:
</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64-i686-dev
</pre>

<p>
Then install the various libraries by compiling from source.  For wxWidgets
I apply a
<a href="https://survex.com/software/wxWidgets-3.2.4.patch">patch</a> to
disable a pointless and annoying compiler ABI check
(with this check aven stops working each time my cross compiler package is
upgraded to a new GCC version; without it everything works fine).
</p>

<p>
Then I configure, build and install with:
</p>

<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32 --host i686-w64-mingw32 --with-msw --with-opengl --enable-display --disable-shared host_alias=i686-w64-mingw32
make
sudo make install
</pre>

<p>
For sqlite (needed by PROJ):
</p>

<pre>
wget https://www.sqlite.org/2021/sqlite-autoconf-3360000.tar.gz
tar xvf sqlite-autoconf-3360000.tar.gz
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
../configure --prefix=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32 --host i686-w64-mingw32 --disable-shared --disable-fts4 --disable-fts5 --disable-json1 --disable-rtree host_alias=i686-w64-mingw32
make
sudo make install
</pre>

<p>
Sadly newer versions of PROJ have to be built with cmake.  For PROJ 9.3.0
I used the following (TIFF is apparently useful for some grids, but would also
need libtiff):
</p>

<pre>
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/git/survex/cross-mingw.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32 -DENABLE_CURL=OFF -DENABLE_TIFF=OFF -DBUILD_PROJSYNC=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY=ON -DCMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY=OFF -DCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY=ON -DFETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
make
sudo make install
</pre>

<p>where <tt>cross-mingw.cmake</tt> contains:</p>

<pre>
# the name of the target operating system
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)

# which compilers to use for C and C++
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-g++)

# where is the target environment located
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  /usr/i686-w64-mingw32)

# adjust the default behaviour of the FIND_XXX() commands:
# search programs in the host environment
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)

# search headers and libraries in the target environment
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
</pre>

<p>
For ffmpeg 4.4.1:
</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install yasm
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
../configure --prefix=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32 --cross-prefix=i686-w64-mingw32- --enable-cross-compile --target-os=mingw32 --arch=i686 --disable-shared --disable-decoders --disable-demuxers --disable-programs --disable-network --disable-bsfs --disable-protocols --disable-devices
make
sudo make install
</pre>

<p>
You'll also need to install GDAL, which requires a lot of other libraries
installed to build.  I gave up at this point.
</p>

<H2>Microsoft Windows Installer Builder</H2>

<p>We use <A HREF="https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">InnoSetup</A> to
build the MS Windows Installer.  Since 1.4.9 we use the InnoSetup version
which is pre-installed in the Github CI images.
</p>

<p>
Survex 1.4.8 was built using InnoSetup 6.2.2.
</p>

<p>
Here are some random notes on the old cross-building approach:
</p>

<H3>Packages Needed</H3>

<P>On Debian unstable/testing:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install wine wx3.0-i18n
</pre>

<P>And then run:

<pre>
wine ~/Downloads/innosetup-6.2.2.exe
</pre>

<H3>Translations</H3>

<P>In addition to the translations included with InnoSetup as standard, we also
add these, which you can find in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of Survex's
source tree:

<UL>
<li>ChineseSimplified.isl (6.1.0+)
<li>ChineseTraditional.isl (6.1.0+)
<li>EnglishBritish.isl (6.1.0+)
<li>Greek.isl (6.1.0+)
<li>Indonesian.isl (6.1.0+)
<li>Romanian.isl (6.1.0+)
</UL>

These are taken from the <a href="https://jrsoftware.org/files/istrans/">Inno
Setup Translations</a> page.

<H3>survex.iss</H3>

<P>This file is generated by configure (from the template survex.iss.in).
We could instead have a static survex.iss which uses #include to pull in
a file with the Survex version info in, but the current method works well
enough so we'll stick with it for now (I suspect #include was introduced since
we started using InnoSetup).
