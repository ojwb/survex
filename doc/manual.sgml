``Quick start'' section

- install (by OS): unpacking, configuration (language, where support files live)

- lead people through entering and processing
a sample survey.  Take examples from surveying books and real surveys.


<Para>The other really important commands apart from *BEGIN, *END, and
*INCLUDE are *EQUATE and *FIX.
</Para>

<Para>*EQUATE is used to join surveys together, e.g.
</Para>

<programlisting>*equate entrance.6 adrian.1</programlisting>

<Para>
indicates that station 6 of the entrance survey was used as
the station 1 of the Adrian's Route survey.
</Para>

<Para>*FIX is for fixing control points - for example:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*fix 161.entrance.1    0  0  1780</programlisting>

<Para>fixes the 1st point of the 'entrance' survey at the coordinates
0 (east-west), 0 (north-south), 1780 (altitude).
</Para>


<term>node</term>
<listitem><para>when talking about the survey network, we talk about an
<emphasis>n</emphasis>-node to describe the number of connections to
a station.  So a 1-node is a station with only 1 leg to or from it
- i.e. The end of a passage or survey. A
2-node is a typical station along a passage with a survey leg coming
into it, and one going out.  A 3-node is a station with three legs
joining it, e.g. at a T-junction. And so on.

  <Abstract>
   <Para>
    This is the manual for <Application>Survex</Application> - an open-source software package for
    cave surveyors.
   </Para>
  </Abstract>
 </articleinfo>

<Sect1><Title>Introduction</Title>
<?dbhtml filename="intro.htm">

<Para>
This section describes what <Application>Survex</Application> is, and outlines the scope of this
manual.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>About <Application>Survex</Application></Title>

<Para><Application>Survex</Application> is a multi-platform open-source cave surveying
package.
Version 1.2 runs on UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and macOS.
We're investigating support for phones and tablets.
</Para>

<Para>We are well aware that not everyone has access to super hardware
- often surveying projects are run on little or no budget and any
computers used are donated.  We aim to ensure that <Application>Survex</Application> is
feasible to use on low-spec machines.  Obviously it won't be as
responsive, but we intend it to be usable.
Please help us to achieve this by giving us some feedback
if you use <Application>Survex</Application> on a slow machine.</Para>

<Para><Application>Survex</Application> is capable of processing extremely complex caves very
quickly and has a very effective, real-time cave viewer which allows
you to rotate, zoom, and pan the cave using mouse or keyboard. We have
tested it extensively using <Acronym>CUCC</Acronym> and <Acronym>ARGE</Acronym>'s surveys of the caves
under the Loser Plateau in Austria (over 25,000 survey legs, and over
140km of underground survey data). This can all be processed in around
10 seconds on a low-end netbook.
Survex is also used by many other survey projects around the world,
including the 
<ulink url="http://www.oucc.org.uk/draenen/draenenmain.htm"
>Ogof Draenen</ulink> survey, the 
<ulink url="http://www.easegill.org.uk/">Easegill</ulink> resurvey project,
the <Acronym>OFD</Acronym> survey, the

><Acronym>OUCC</Acronym> Picos expeditions</ulink>, and the 
<ulink url="http://www.hongmeigui.net/">Hong Meigui China
expeditions</ulink>. <!-- FIXME more? --></Para>

<Para><Application>Survex</Application> is still actively being worked on.  Version 1.0 was
complete in some sense, but development continues - initially in reshaping
Survex into a more integrated GUI package.</Para>

<Para>We encourage feedback from users on important features or problems,
which will help to direct future development.  See the "Mailing List" section
of this manual for the best way to contact us.</Para>

</Sect2>

<!--
<Para>Because <Application>Survex</Application> is still being actively developed, this document
has an unfortunate tendency to lag slightly behind the capabilities of the
software. The latest version is now available on the web at <ulink

<Sect2><Title>About this Manual</Title>

<Para>
If there's a part of this manual you find hard to understand, please do
let us know.  We already know Survex well, so it can be hard for us
to spot areas where the manual doesn't given enough information, or
doesn't explain things clearly enough to follow when you don't know what's
going on.  It's helpful is you can suggest a better wording, but don't worry
if you can't, just explain the problem as precisely as you can.
</Para>

<Para>
The master version of this manual is an <acronym>SGML</acronym>
document written using the <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org/">docbook
<acronym>DTD</acronym></ulink>,
and automatically converted to a number of other formats.  If
you are going to send us <emphasis>major</emphasis> changes, it's much easier
to include them if you work from this master.  You can get it
from the source archive (docs/manual.sgml) or from <ulink
url="https://survex.com/docs.html">the Survex website</ulink>.

<Sect1><Title>Getting Started</Title>
<?dbhtml filename="getstart.htm">

<Para>This section covers how to obtain the software, and how to unpack and
install it, and how to configure it.</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Obtaining <Application>Survex</Application></Title>

<Para>The latest version is available from the <Application>Survex</Application> website:
<ulink url="https://survex.com/">https://survex.com/</ulink>.  It is also
freely redistributable, so you welcome to get a copy from someone else
who has already downloaded it.</Para>

<Para>If you want some sample data to experiment with, you can download some
from the Survex website too:

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Installing <Application>Survex</Application></Title>

<Para>The details of installation depend greatly on what platform you
are using, so there is a separate section below for each platform.</Para>

<Sect3><Title>Linux</Title>

<Para>
We supply pre-compiled versions for x86 Linux machines in RPM format
(suitable for Redhat, Mandrake, and some other distributions).
Survex Debian packages are available from Debian mirror sites in
the usual way.
</Para>

<Para>
You'll need root access to install these prebuilt packages.
If you don't have root access you will need to build from source
(see the next section).
</Para>

<!-- FIXME Add Gnome file association note for Linux/Unix
<Para>On Microsoft Windows, <Application>Survex</Application> installs with
suitable file associations so that you can drive it from the GUI.
On UNIX you need to drive <Application>Survex</Application> from a command-line
prompt (or set some a filemanager or graphics shell).
</Para>
-->

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>Other versions of UNIX</Title>

<Para>For other UNIX versions you'll need to get the source code
and compile it on your system.  Unpack the sources and read
the file called INSTALL in the top level for details about building
from source.
</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>macOS</Title>

<Para>
The easiest way to install a recent release of Survex on macOS is by using
the Homebrew package manager. If you don't already use Homebrew, you'll
need to install it first.  See the
<ulink url="https://survex.com/download.html?platform=macosx">macOS
download page on the website</ulink> for installation instructions.
</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>Microsoft Windows</Title>

<Para>
This version comes packaged with an installation wizard.  Just
run the downloaded package and it will lead you through the
installation process.  If you want the file associations to be
set up for all user, run the installer as administrator, or as a
user with administrator rights.
</Para>

<Para>
The survey viewer that's part of <Application>Survex</Application> is called
aven, and uses OpenGL for 3d rendering.
</Para>

<Para>
If you find that 3D rendering is sometimes very slow (e.g. one user reported
very slow performance when running full screen, while running in a window
was fine) then try installing the OpenGL driver supplied by the manufacturer
of your graphics card rather than the driver Microsoft supply.
</Para>

<Para>
The installer creates a Survex group in the Programs sub-menu of the
Start menu containing the following items:

Double-clicking on a <filename>.svx</filename> file loads it for editing.  To process it to
produce a <filename>.3d</filename> file, right click and choose "Process" from
the menu - this runs aven to process the <filename>.svx</filename> file and

<Sect2><Title>Configuration</Title>

<Sect3><Title>Selecting Your Preferred Language</Title>

<Para>Survex has extensive internationalisation capabilities.  The
language used for messages from Survex and most of the library calls
it uses can be changed.  By default this is picked up from the
language the operating system is set to use (from "Regional Settings"
in Control Panel on Microsoft Windows, from the
<systemitem>LANG</systemitem> environment variable on UNIX
If no setting
is found, or <Application>Survex</Application> hasn't been translated into the
requested language, UK English is used.</Para>

<Para>
However you may want to override the language manually -
for example if Survex isn't available in your native language
you'll want to choose the supported language you understand best.
</Para>

<Para>
To do this, you set the
<systemitem>SURVEXLANG</systemitem> environment variable.  Here's a list
of the codes currently supported:</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Using <Application>Survex</Application></Title>

<Para>
Most common tasks can now be accomplished through Aven - processing survey
data, viewing the processed data, printing, exporting to other formats,
and producing simple extended elevations.
</Para>

<Para>
A few tasks still require you to use the command line.  And some functionality
is available both via aven and from the command line, which allows it to be
scripted.
</Para>

<Para>
The command line programs that come with Survex are:
</Para>

<VariableList>

<VarListEntry><Term>extend</Term>
    <listitem><Para>
	Produces extended elevations - this is probably the most useful of
	these command line tools.  Since version 1.2.27 you can produce simple
	extended elevations from Aven using the "Extended Elevation" function.
	However the command line tool allows you to specify a spec file to
	control how the survey is extended, which you can't currently do via
	Aven.
    </Para></listitem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry><Term>diffpos</Term>
    <listitem><Para>
	Compares the positions of stations in two .3d, .pos, etc files.

<VarListEntry><Term>sorterr</Term>
    <listitem><Para>
	 Sorts a .err file by a specified field.
    </Para></listitem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry><Term>survexport</Term>
    <listitem><Para>
	Provides access to Aven's "Export" functionality from the command line,
	which can be useful in scripts.
    </Para></listitem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry><Term>cavern</Term>
    <listitem><Para>
	Processes survey data, but since version 1.2.3 you can process .svx
	files by simply opening them with Aven, so you no longer need to run
	cavern from the command line.  The main reason to run cavern directly
	is for use in scripts.
    </Para></listitem>

<Sect2><Title>Standard Options</Title>

<Para>All <Application>Survex</Application> programs respond to the following command line options:

<VariableList>

<VarListEntry><Term>--help</Term><listitem><Para>

</Para></listitem></VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry><Term>--version</Term><listitem><Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Short and Long Options</Title>

<Para>
Options have two forms: short (a dash followed by a single letter e.g.
<command>cavern -q</command>) and long (two dashes followed by one or more words e.g.
<command>cavern --quiet</command>).  The long form is generally easier to
remember, while the short form is quicker to type.  Options are often
available in both forms.
</Para>

<Note><Para>Command line options are case sensitive, so "-B" and "-b"
are different (this didn't used to be the case before Survex 0.90).  Case
sensitivity doubles the number of available short options (and is also the
norm on UNIX).
</Para></Note>
</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Filenames on the Command Line</Title>

<Para>Filenames with spaces can be processed (provided your operating system
supports them - UNIX does, and so do modern versions of Microsoft
Windows).  You need to enclose the filename in quotes like so:
<userinput>cavern "Spider Cave"</userinput>
</Para>

<Para>A file specified on the command line of any of the <Application>Survex</Application> suite
of programs will be looked for as specified.  If it is not found, then the
file is looked for with the appropriate extension appended.  So
<userinput>cavern survey</userinput> will look first for
<filename>survey</filename>, then for <filename>survey.svx</filename>.

<Sect1><Title><Application>Survex</Application> data files</Title>
<?dbhtml filename="datafile.htm">

<Para>Survey data is entered in the form of text files. You can use any
text editor you like for this, so long as it has the capability of
writing a plain ASCII text file. The data format is very flexible;
unlike some other cave surveying software, Survex does not require
survey legs to be rearranged to suit the computer, and the ordering 
of instrument readings on each line is fully specifiable.  So you can enter
your data much as it appears on the survey notes, which is important
in reducing the opportunities for transcription errors.
</Para>

<Para>
Also all the special characters are user-definable - for example,
the separators can be spaces and tabs, or commas (e.g. when exporting from a
spreadsheet), etc; the decimal point can be a slash (for clarity), a comma
(as used in continental Europe), or anything else you care to choose.
This flexibility
means that it should be possible to read in data from almost any sort of
survey data file without much work.
</Para>

<Para><Application>Survex</Application> places no restrictions on you in terms of the ordering
of survey legs. You can enter or process data in any order and <Application>Survex</Application> will
read it all in before determining how it is connected. You can also use the
hierarchical naming so that you do not need to worry about using the same
station name twice.
</Para>

<!-- FIXME don't encourage separate processing -->
<Para>The usual arrangement is to have one file which lists all the others
that are included (e.g., <filename>161.svx</filename>). Then
<command>cavern 161</command> will process all your data. To just process a
section use the filename for that section, e.g. <command>cavern dtime</command>
will process the dreamtime file/section of Kaninchenh&ouml;hle.  To
help you out, if all legs in a survey are connected to one another
but the survey has no fixed points, cavern
will 'invent' a fixed point and print a warning message to this
effect.

<Para>
It is up to you what data you put in which files.  You
can have one file per trip, or per area of the cave, or just one
file for the whole cave if you like.
On a large survey project it makes sense to group related surveys in the
same file or directory.

<Para>Blank lines (i.e. lines consisting solely of BLANK characters)
are ignored. The last line in the file need not be terminated by
an end of line character. All fields on a line must be separated
by at least one BLANK character. An OMIT character
(default '-') indicates that a field is unused. If the field is
not optional, then an error is given.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Survey Station Names</Title>

<Para><Application>Survex</Application> has a powerful system for naming stations.  It
uses a hierarchy of survey names, similar to the nested folders
your computer stores files in.
So point 6 in the entrance survey of Kaninchenh&ouml;hle
(cave number 161) is referred to as: 161.entrance.6
</Para>

<Para>This seems a natural way to refer to station names.  It also
means that it is very easy to include more levels, for example if you
want to plot all the caves in the area you just list them all in
another file, specifying a new prefix.  So to group 3 nearby caves
on the Loser Plateau you would use a file like
this:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin Loser
*include 161
*include 2YrGest
*include 145
*end Loser</programlisting>

<Para>
The entrance series point mentioned above would now be referred
to as: Loser.161.entrance.6
</Para>

<!--
<Para>This may seem a tad complex but is really very natural once you
get the hang of it.
</Para>
-->
<Para>You do not have to use this system at all, and can just give all
stations unique identifiers if you like:
</Para>

<Para>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... 1381, 1382

<Para>or

</Para>

<!-- FIXME:

<Para>Station and survey names may contain any alphanumeric characters and
additionally any characters in NAMES (default `_' and `-'). Alphabetic
characters may be forced to upper or lower case by using the *case

the first few characters as significant you can get cavern to truncate
the names using the *truncate command.

<Sect3><Title>Anonymous Stations</Title>

<Para>
Survex supports the concept of anonymous survey stations.  That is
survey stations without a name.  Each time an anonymous station name is
used it represents a different point.  Currently three types of anonymous
station are supported, referred to by one, two or three separator characters
- with the default separator of '.', that means '.', '..', and '...' are
anonymous stations.  Their meanings are:</Para>

<VariableList>
<VarListEntry><Term>Single separator ('.' by default)</Term>
<ListItem><Para>
An anonymous non-wall point at the end of an implicit splay.
</Para></ListItem></VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry><Term>Double separator ('..' by default)</Term>

with your CPU [e.g. the new Acorn FPU for the ARM], and numerical
accuracy [compared to using floats at least]) and so may be adopted
in future). Nearest 0.1mm gives -200 km, which is enough for most

</Para>

<Para>
You need to be careful about the sign of the ZeroError.  Survex follows
the convention used with scientific instruments - the ZeroError is what
the instrument reads when measuring a reading which should be zero.  So
for example, if your tape measure has the end missing, and you are using the
30cm mark to take all measurements from, then a zero distance would be measured
as 30cm and you would correct this with:
</Para>

<programlisting>*CALIBRATE tape +0.3</programlisting>

<Para>If you tape was too long, starting at -20cm (it does happen!)
then you can correct it with:
</Para>

<programlisting>*CALIBRATE tape -0.2</programlisting>

<Para>Note: ZeroError is irrelevant for Topofil counters and depth
gauges since pairs of readings are subtracted.
</Para>

<Para>
In the first form in the synopsis above, the zero error is measured by the
instrument itself (e.g. reading off the number where a truncated tape now ends)
and any scale factor specified applies to it, like so:
</Para>

<Para>
Value = ( Reading - ZeroError ) * Scale    (Scale defaults to 1.0)
</Para>

<Para>
In the second form above (supported since Survex 1.2.21), the zero error has
been measured externally (e.g. measuring how much too long your tape is with
a ruler) - the units of the zero error are explicitly specified and any scale
factor isn't applied to it:
</Para>

<Para>
Value = ( Reading * Scale ) - ZeroError    (Scale defaults to 1.0)
</Para>

<Para>
If the scale factor is 1.0, then the two forms are equivalent, though they
still allow you to differentiate between how the zero error has been determined.
</Para>

<Para>
With older Survex versions, you would specify the magnetic declination
(difference between True North and Magnetic North) by using *calibrate
declination to set an explicit value (with no scale factor allowed).  Since
Survex 1.2.22, it's recommended to instead use the new *declination command
instead - see the documentation of that command for more details.

<!-- FIXME - work this text in here or elsewhere

What I mean (though failed to express very well) is that a dataset without
this information isn't the same dataset (in general anyway).  For example:

A1 a2 10.32 140 -05
a2 a3  4.91 041 -01
a1 a3  7.01 206  02

is either a traverse of 3 legs or a (probably badly misclosed) loop.  If
these names are on the original survey notes, the surveyors ought to say
whether "A1" is the same as "a1" (although the usual case for using this
feature is probably for importing data from elsewhere).  Similarly for
truncation.  Whether a clino of +/-90 degrees (or +/-100 grad, etc) is
interpreted as a plumb is something that should have been noted in the cave
(unless it's implicit because it's standard practice for a survey project).

It's a similar issue to calibration data in many ways.  You can argue it's
not part of "the survey", but without it the survey won't be the same shape,
and it's not useful to process the same survey with different settings for
compass calibration or name case sensitivity.

>Clearly that is unhelpfully strict, but it is

Think of the lines starting with a "*" as "command or meta-data".

-C has always had 3 settings - "leave case alone", "force to lower", and
"force to upper".  It doesn't really mean "case sensitivity" but rather
something like "case processing".  So you can usefully change it during a
run.  So if my dataset treats "NoTableChamber" (so named because it was
lacking in furniture) as different from "NotableChamber" (which was notable
for other reasons) I can process it with a dataset from someone else which
needs to be treated as case insensitive like so:

*begin my_cave
*include my_dataset
*end my_cave

*equate my_cave.NoTableChamber.14 your_cave.linkpassage.13

*begin your_cave
*case tolower
*include your_dataset
*end your_cave

You may be thinking of -U<n>, which used to mean "only compare the first n
characters of station names", but that doesn't allow arbitrary datasets to
be processed together.

So we changed it to mean "truncate station names to n characters", and
allowed it to be changed at any point, rather than being set once for the
whole run.

<Para>OSGB: followed by a two letter code for the UK Ordnance Survey National

</Para>

<Para>UTM followed by a zone number (1-60), optionally followed by "N" or "S"
(default is North).  The WGS84 datum is assumed.</Para>

<Para>
By default, Survex works in an unspecified coordinate system (and this was the
only option before *cs was added).  However, it's useful for coordinate system
which the processed survey data is in to be specified if you want to use the
processed data in ways which required knowing the coordinate system (such as
exporting a list of entrances for use in a GPS).  You can now do this by using
"*cs out".
</Para>

<Para>
It is also useful to be able to take coordinates for fixed points in whatever
coordinate system you receive them in and put them directly into Survex, rather
than having to convert with an external tool.  For example, you may have your
GPS set to show coordinates in UTM with the WGS84 datum, even though you want
the processed data to be in some local coordinate system.  And someone else
may provide GPS coordinates in yet another coordinate system.  You just need
to set the appropriate coordinate system with "*cs" before each group of "*fix"
commands in a particular coordinate system.
</Para>

<Para>
If you're going to make use of "*cs", then the coordinate system must be
specified for everything, so a coordinate system must be in effect for all
"*fix" commands, and you must set the output coordinate system before any
points are fixed.
</Para>

<Para>
Also, if "*cs" is in use, then you can't omit the coordinates in a "*fix"
command, and a fixed point won't be invented if none exists.
</Para>

<Para>
If you use "*cs out" more than once, the second and subsequent commands are
silently ignored - this makes it possible to combine two datasets with
different "*cs out" settings without having to modify either of them.
</Para>

<Para>
Something to be aware of with "*cs" is that altitudes are currently assumed to
be "height above the ellipsoid", whereas GPS units typically give you "height
above sea level", or more accurately "height above a particular geoid".  This
is something we're looking at how best to address, but you shouldn't need to
worry about it if your fixed points are in the same coordinate system as your
output, or if they all use the same ellipsoid.  For a more detailed discussion
of this, please see: http://expo.survex.com/handbook/survey/coord.htm

There are two variants of each style - interleaved and non-interleaved.
Non-interleaved is "one line per leg", interleaved has a line for the data
shared between two legs (e.g. STATION=FROM/TO, DEPTH=FROMDEPTH/TODEPTH,
COUNT=FROMCOUNT/TOCOUNT).  Note that not all readings that can be shared
have to be, for example here the to/from station name is shared but the
depth gauge readings aren't:

<programlisting>
*data diving station newline fromdepth compass tape todepth</programlisting>

In addition, interleaved data can have a DIRECTION reading, which can be "F"
for a foresight or "B" for a backsight (meaning the direction of the leg is
reversed).
</Para>

<Para>
In interleaved data, a blank line (one which contains only characters which
are set as BLANK) ends the current traverse so can be used to handle
branches in the survey, e.g.:
<programlisting>

</Para>

<Para>
In data styles which include a TAPE reading (i.e. NORMAL, DIVING, and CYLPOLAR
data styles), TAPE may be replaced by FROMCOUNT/TOCOUNT (or COUNT in
interleaved data) to allow processing of surveys performed with a Topofil
instead of a tape.
</Para>

<Para>
In Survex 1.2.44 and later, you can use <command>*data</command> without any
arguments to keep the currently set data style, but resetting any state.  This

<VarListEntry><Term>NORMAL</Term>
<listitem><Para>The usual tape/compass/clino centreline survey.
For non-interleaved data the allowed readings are:
FROM TO TAPE COMPASS CLINO BACKCOMPASS BACKCLINO;
for interleaved data the allowed readings are:
STATION DIRECTION TAPE COMPASS CLINO BACKCOMPASS BACKCLINO.
The CLINO/BACKCLINO reading is not required - if it's not given, the vertical
standard deviation is taken to be proportional to the tape measurement.
Alternatively, individual clino readings can be given as OMIT (default "-")
which allows for data where only some clino readings are missing.

An underwater survey where the vertical information is from a diver's depth
gauge.  This style can also be also used for an above-water survey where the
altitude is measured with an altimeter.  DEPTH is defined as the altitude (Z)
so increases upwards by default.  So for a diver's depth gauge, you'll need to
use *CALIBRATE with a negative scale factor (e.g. *calibrate depth 0 -1).

<Para>Survex 1.2.20 and later allow an optional CLINO and/or BACKCLINO reading
in DIVING style.  At present these extra readings are checked for syntactic
validity, but are otherwise ignored.  The intention is that a future version
will check them against the other readings to flag up likely blunders, and
average with the slope data from the depth gauge and tape reading.</Para>

<Para>For interleaved data the allowed readings are:

<VarListEntry><Term>PASSAGE</Term>
<listitem><Para>
This survey style defines a 3D "tube" modelling a passage in the cave.
The tube uses the survey stations listed in the order listed.  It's
permitted to use survey stations which aren't directly linked by
the centre-line survey.  This can be useful - sometimes the centreline
will step sideways or up/down to allow a better sight for the next
leg and you can ignore the extra station.  You can also define tubes
along unsurveyed passages, akin to "nosurvey" legs in the centreline
data.</Para>

<Para>This means that you need to split off side passages into seperate
tubes, and hence separate sections of passage data, starting with
a new *data command.</Para>

<Para>
Simple example of how to use this data style (note the use of ignoreall
to allow a free-form text description to be given):

<programlisting>
*data passage station left right up down ignoreall
1  0.1 2.3 8.0 1.4  Sticking out point on left wall
2  0.0 1.9 9.0 0.5  Point on left wall
3  1.0 0.7 9.0 0.8  Highest point of boulder
</programlisting>

Each <command>*data passage</command> data block describes a single continuous
tube - to break a tube or to enter a side passage you need to have a second
block.  With Survex 1.2.30 and older, you had to repeat the entire
<command>*data passage</command> line to start a new tube, but in Survex 1.2.31
and later, you can just use <command>*data</command> without any arguments.
</Para>

<Para>
For example here the main passage is 1-2-3 and a side passage is 2-4:

<programlisting>
*data passage station left right up down ignoreall
1  0.1 2.3 8.0 1.4  Sticking out point on left wall
2  0.0 1.9 9.0 0.5  Point on left wall opposite side passage
3  1.0 0.7 9.0 0.8  Highest point of boulder
; If you're happy to require Survex 1.2.31 or later, you can just use
; "*data" here instead.
*data passage station left right up down ignoreall
2  0.3 0.2 9.0 0.5
4  0.0 0.5 6.5 1.5  Fossil on left wall

</listitem>

</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry><Term>Description</Term>

<listitem>

<Para>
The *declination command is the modern way to specify magnetic declinations in
Survex.  Prior to 1.2.22, *calibrate declination was used instead.  If you
use a mixture of *calibrate declination and *declination, they interact in
the natural way - whichever was set most recently is used for each compass
reading (taking into account survey scope).  We don't generally recommend
mixing the two, but it's useful to understand how they interact if you want to
combine datasets using the old and new commands, and perhaps if you have a
large existing dataset and want to migrate it without having to change
everything at once.
</Para>

<Para>
Magnetic declination is the difference between Magnetic North and True North.
It varies both with location and over time.  Compass bearings are measured
relative to Magnetic North - adding the magnetic declination gives bearings
relative to True North.
</Para>

<Para>
If you have specified the output coordinate system (using *cs out) then you can
use *declination auto (and we recommend that you do).  This is supported since
Survex 1.2.21 and automatically calculates magnetic declinations based on the
IGRF (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) model for the specified date
of each survey and at the specified representative location (given in the
current input coordinate system, as set with *cs).  Survex 1.2.27 and
later also automatically correct for grid convergence (the difference between
Grid North and True North) when *declination auto is in use, based on the same
specified representative location.  A revised version of the IGRF model is
usually issued every 5 years - Survex 1.2.43 updated to using version 13 in
early 2020.
</Para>

<Para>
You might wonder why Survex needs a representative location instead of
calculating the magnetic declination and grid convergence for the actual
position of each survey station.  The reason is that we need to adjust the
compass bearings before we can solve the network to find survey station
locations.  Both magnetic declination and grid convergence don't generally vary
significantly over the area of a typical cave system - if you are mapping a
very large cave system, or caves over a wide area, or are working close to a
magnetic pole or where the output coordinate system is rather distorted, then
you can specify *declination auto several times with different locations - the
one currently in effect is used for each survey leg.
</Para>

<Para>
Generally it's best to specify a suitable output coordinate system, and use
*declination auto so Survex corrects for magnetic declination and grid
convergence for you.  Then Aven knows how to translate coordinates to allow
export to formats such as GPX and KML, and to overlay terrain data.
</Para>

<Para>
If you don't specify an output coordinate system, but fix one or more points
then Survex works implicitly in the coordinate system your fixed points were
specified in.  This mode of operation is provided for compatibility with
datasets from before support for explicit coordinate systems was added to
Survex - it's much better to specify the output coordinate system as above.
But if you have a survey of a cave which isn't connected to any known fixed
points then you'll need to handle it this way, either fixing an entrance
to some arbitrary coordinates (probably (0,0,0)) or letting Survex pick a
station as the origin.  If the survey was all done in a short enough period
of time that the magnetic declination won't have changed significantly, you
can just ignore it and Grid North in the implicit coordinate system will be
Magnetic North at the time of the survey.  If you want to correct for magnetic
declination, you can't use *declination auto because the IGRF model needs the
real world coordinates, but you can specify literal declination values for each
survey using *declination &lt;declination&gt; &lt;units&gt;.  Then Grid North
in the implicit coordinate system is True North.
</Para>

<Para>
Note that the value specified uses the conventional sign for magnetic
declination, unlike the old *calibrate declination which needed a value with
the opposite sign (because *calibrate specifies a zero error), so take care
when updating old data, or if you're used to the semantics of *calibrate
declination.

*fix fixes the position of &lt;station&gt; at the given coordinates.
If you haven't specified the coordinate system with "*cs", you can
omit the position and it will default to (0,0,0).  The standard errors default
to zero (fix station exactly).  cavern will give an error if you attempt to fix
the same survey station twice at different coordinates, or a warning if you fix
it twice with matching coordinates.
</Para>

<Para>
You can also specify just one standard error (in which case it is assumed
equal in X, Y, and Z) or two (in which case the first is taken as the
standard error in X and Y, and the second as the standard error in Z).
</Para>

<Para>
If you have covariances for the fix, you can also specify these - the
order is cov(x,y) cov(y,z) cov(z,x). 
</Para>

<Para>
If you've specified a coordinate system (see <command>*cs</command>) then
that determines the meaning of X, Y and Z (if you want to specify the
units for altitude, note that using a PROJ string containing
<command>+vunits</command> allows this - e.g. <command>+vunits=us-ft</command>
for US survey feet).  If you don't specify a coordinate system, then the
coordinates must be in metres.  The standard deviations must always be
in metres (and the covariances in metres squared).
</Para>

<Para>
You can fix as many stations as you like - just use a *fix command for each
one.  Cavern will check that all stations are connected to
at least one fixed point so that co-ordinates can be calculated for all
stations.
</Para>

<Para>
By default cavern will warn about stations which have been FIX-ed but
not used otherwise, as this might be due to a typo in the station
name.  This is unhelpful if you want to include a standard file of benchmarks,
some of which won't be used.  In this sort of situation, specify "REFERENCE"
after the station name in the FIX command to suppress this warning for a
particular station.
</Para>

<Note><Para>
X is Easting, Y is Northing, and Z is altitude.  This convention was chosen
since on a map, the horizontal (X) axis is usually East, and the vertical
axis (Y) North.  The choice of altitude (rather than depth) for Z is taken
from surface maps, and makes for less confusion when dealing with cave
systems with more than one entrance.  It also gives a right-handed
set of axes.

<Para>"*infer plumbs on" tells cavern to interpret gradients of +/- 90
degrees as UP/DOWN (so it
will not apply the clino correction to them). This is useful when
the data has not been converted to have UP and DOWN in it.
</Para>

<para>"*infer equates on" tells cavern to interpret a leg with
a tape reading of zero as a *equate.  this prevents tape corrections
being applied to them.
</para>

<para>"*infer exports on" is necessary when you have a dataset which is
partly annotated with *export.  It tells cavern not to complain about
missing *export commands in part of the dataset.  Also stations which
were used to join surveys are marked as exported in the 3d file.

</Para>

<!-- FIXME mention central limit theorem -->
<Para>
To utilise this command fully you need to understand what a
<emphasis>standard deviation</emphasis> is.
It gives a value to the 'spread' of the errors
in a measurement. Assuming that these are normally distributed
we can say that 95.44% of the actual lengths will fall within two
standard deviations of the measured length. i.e. a tape SD of
0.25 metres means that the actual length of a tape measurement
is within + or - 0.5 metres of the recorded value 95.44% of the time.
So if the measurement is 7.34m then the actual length is very
likely to be between 6.84m and 7.84m. This example corresponds
to BCRA grade 3. Note that this is just one interpretation of
the BCRA standard, taking the permitted error values as 2SD 95.44%
confidence limits. If you want to take the readings as being some
other limit (e.g. 1SD = 68.26%) then you will need to change the BCRA3
and BCRA5 files accordingly. This issue is explored in more
detail in various surveying articles.

non-zero.
</Para>

<Para>Valid units for listed quantities are:
</Para>

<Para>TAPE/LENGTH, BACKTAPE/BACKLENGTH, COUNTER/COUNT, DEPTH, DX/EASTING, DY/NORTHING, DZ/ALTITUDE

in DEGS|DEGREES|GRADS|MINUTES|QUADS|QUADRANTS (default: DEGREES)
</Para>

<Para>(360 degrees = 400 grads)
</Para>

<Para>
QUADRANTS are a style of bearing used predominantly in land survey, and occasionally
in survey with handheld instruments. All bearings are N or S, a numeric from 0 to
90, followed by E or W. For example S34E to refer to 146 degrees, or 34 degrees in
the SE quadrant. In this format, exact cardinal directions may be simply alphabetic.
E.g. N is equivalent to N0E and E is equivalent to N90E. This unit was added in Survex
1.2.44.
</Para>

<Para>
Survex has long support MILS as an alias for GRADS.  However, this seems to
be a bogus definition of a "mil" which is unique to Survex (except that Therion
has since copied it) - there are several different definitions of a "mil" but
they vary from 6000 to 6400 in a full circle, not 400.  Because of this we
deprecated MILS in Survex 1.2.38 - you can still process data which uses them
but you'll now get a warning, and we recommend you update your data.
</Para>

<Para>
For example, if your data uses

<programlisting>
*units compass mils</programlisting>

then you need to determine what the intended units actually are.  If there
are 400 in a full circle, then instead use this (which will work with older
Survex versions too):

<programlisting>
*units compass grads</programlisting>

If the units are actually mils, you can specify that in terms of degrees.
For example, for NATO mils (6400 in a full circle) you can use this (which
also works with older Survex versions):

<programlisting>
*units compass 0.05625 degrees</programlisting>

</Para>

<programlisting>
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7

4 5  2.98  - DOWN
5 6  9.29 271 -28.5</programlisting>

<Para>
You can vary the data ordering.  The default is:
</Para>

<Para>
from-station to-station tape compass clino
</Para>

<Para>
This data demonstrates a number of useful features of <Application>Survex</Application>:
</Para>

<Para>
Legs can be measured either way round, which allows the use of
techniques like "leap-frogging" (which is where legs
alternate forwards and backwards).
</Para>

<Para>
Also notice that there is a spur in the survey (2 to 3).  You
do not need to specify this specially.
</Para>

<Para>
<Application>Survex</Application> places few restrictions on station naming (see "Survey
Station Names" in the previous section), so you can number the stations
as they were in the original survey notes.  Although not apparent from
this example, there is no requirement for each leg to connect to an
existing station.  <Application>Survex</Application> can accept data in any order, and will
check for connectedness once all the data has been read in.
</Para>

<Para>
Each survey is also likely to have other information associated
with it, such as instrument calibrations, etc.  This has been
omitted from this example to keep things simple.
</Para>

<Para>
Most caves will take more than just one survey trip to map.  Commonly
the numbering in each survey will begin at 1, so we need to be
able to tell apart stations with the same number in different
surveys.
</Para>

<Para>
To accomplish this, <Application>Survex</Application> has a very flexible system of hierarchical
prefixes.  All you need do is give each survey a unique name or
number, and enter the data like so:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin 163
*export 1
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
2 4  7.89 254 -11
4 5  2.98  - DOWN
5 6  9.29 271 -28.5
*end 163</programlisting>

<Para><Application>Survex</Application> will name the stations by attaching the current prefix.
In this case, the stations will be named 163.1, 163.2, etc.
</Para>

<Para>We have a convention with the CUCC Austria data that the entrance survey
station of a cave is named P&lt;cave number&gt;, P163 in this case. We
can accomplish this like so:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*equate P163 163.1
*entrance P163
*begin 163
*export 1
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
2 4  7.89 254 -11
4 5  2.98  - DOWN
5 6  9.29 271 -28.5
*end 163</programlisting>

<Sect2><Title>Specify surface survey data</Title>

<Para>
Say you have 2 underground surveys and 2 surface ones with 2 fixed reference
points.  You want to mark the surface surveys so that their length isn't
included in length statistics, and so that Aven knows to display them
differently.  To do this you mark surface data with the "surface" flag
- this is set with "*flags surface" like so:
</Para>

<programlisting>
; fixed reference points
*fix fix_a 12345 56789 1234
*fix fix_b 23456 67890 1111                                                     
                                                                                
; surface data (enclosed in *begin ... *end to stop the *flags command
; from "leaking" out)
*begin
*flags surface
*include surface1
*include surface2
*end                                                                            
                                                                                
; underground data
*include cave1
*include cave2</programlisting>

<Para>
You might also have a survey which starts on the surface and heads into a
cave.  This can be easily handled too - here's an example which goes in
one entrance, through the cave, and out of another entrance:
</Para>

<programlisting>

<Para>
Note that to avoid needless complication, Survex regards each leg as
being either "surface" or "not surface" - if a leg spans the boundary you'll
have to call it one or the other.  It's good surveying practice to
deliberately put a station at the surface/underground interface
(typically the highest closed contour or drip line) so this generally
isn't an onerous restriction.

<Para>
They can be given
as +90, or -90, but as they are not usually measured with the
clino, but with a plumb of some sort, then it is useful to distinguish
them in this way so that any clino adjustment is not applied to
these values.
</Para>

FIXME: paste in section from mail to list

<Para>
Note that a similar effect can be achieved by using the "*infer plumbs" command
to stop clino corrections being applied to -90 and +90 clino readings.
</Para>
-->

<Para>
Plumbed legs should be given using 'UP' or 'DOWN' in place of the
clino reading and a dash (or a different specified 'OMIT' character)
in place of the compass reading.  This distinguishes
them from legs measured with a compass and clino.  Here's an example:
</Para>

<programlisting>
1 2 21.54 - UP
3 2 7.36 017 +17
3 4 1.62 091 +08
5 4 10.38 - DOWN</programlisting>

<Para>
U/D or +V/-V may be used instead of UP/DOWN; the check is not case
sensitive.
</Para>

<Para>
Legs surveyed across the surface of a static body of water where no
clino reading is taken (since the surface of the water can be assumed
to be flat) can be indicated by using LEVEL in place of a clino reading.
This prevents the clino correction being applied.  Here's an example:
</Para>

<programlisting>
1 2 11.37 190 -12
3 2  7.36 017 LEVEL
3 4  1.62 091 LEVEL</programlisting>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Specify a BCRA grade</Title>

<Para>The *SD command can be used to specify the standard deviations of the
various measurements (tape, compass, clino, etc).  Examples files are
supplied which define BCRA Grade 3 and BCRA Grade 5 using a number of *sd
commands. You can use these by simply including them at the relevant point,
as follows:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin somewhere
; This survey is only grade 3
*include grade3
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
; etc
*end somewhere</programlisting>

<Para>The default values for the standard deviations are those for
BCRA grade 5. Note that it is good practice to keep the *include
Grade3 within *Begin and *End commands otherwise it will apply
to following survey data, which may not be what you intended.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Specify different accuracy for a leg</Title>

<Para>For example, suppose the tape on the plumbed leg in this survey
is suspected of being less accurate than the rest of the survey because
the length was obtained by measuring the length of the rope used to rig
the pitch.  We can set a higher sd for this one measurement and use a
*begin/*end block to make sure this setting only applies to the one
leg:
</Para>

<programlisting>
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
2 4  7.89 254 -11
*begin
; tape measurement was taken from the rope length
*sd tape 0.5 metres
4 5  34.50 - DOWN
*end
5 6  9.29 271 -28.5</programlisting>

<!-- FIXME also *calibrate and *instrument? Except rope is measure with the
tape... -->
</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Enter Repeated Readings</Title>

<Para>If your survey data contains multiple versions of each leg (for example,
pockettopo produces such data), then provided these are adjacent to one another
Survex 1.2.17 and later will automatically average these and treat them as a
single leg.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Enter Radiolocation Data</Title>

<!-- FIXME comments from David Gibson here -->
<Para>This is done by using the *SD command to specify the appropriate
errors for the radiolocation `survey leg' so that the loop closure
algorithm knows how to distribute errors if it forms part of a loop.
</Para>

<Para>The best approach for a radiolocation where the underground station
is vertically below the surface station is to represent it as a
plumbed leg, giving suitable SDs for the length and plumb angle. The
horizontal positioning of this is generally quite accurate, but the
vertical positioning may be much less well known. E.g: we have a
radiolocation of about 50m depth +/- 20m and horizontal accuracy of
+/- 8m. Over 50m the +/-8m is equivalent to an angle of 9 degrees, so
that is the expected plumb error. 20m is the expected error in the
length. To get the equivalent SD we assume that 99.74% of readings will
be within 3 standard deviations of the error value. Thus we divide the
expected errors by 3 to get the SD we should specify:
</Para> <!-- 3 SD? or same as BCRA3.SVX, etc -->

<programlisting>
*begin
*sd length 6.67 metres
*sd plumb 3 degrees
surface underground 50 - down
*end</programlisting>

<Para>
We wrap the radiolocation leg in a *begin/*end block to make
sure that the special *sd settings only apply to this one leg.
</Para>

<Para>Surveys made underwater using a diver's depth gauge can be

is of this type.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Enter Theodolite data</Title>

<Para>
Theodolite data with turned angles is not yet explicitly catered
for, so for now you will need to convert it into equivalent legs in
another style - normal or cylpolar are likely to be the best choices.
</Para>

<Para>
If there is no vertical info in your theodolite data then you should
use the cylpolar style and use *sd command to specify very low
accuracy (high SD) in the depth so that the points will move in the
vertical plane as required if the end points are fixed or the survey
is part of a loop.

easiest way is to look at some of the example data and use that
as a template. Nearly all surveys will need a bit of basic info
as well as the survey data itself: e.g. the date (*date), comments
about where, what cave, a name for the survey (using *begin and *end),
instrument error corrections etc. Here is a typical survey file:

<Para>Suppose you have two separate bits of surveying which were done on the

want to give a different survey name to the two sections.  This is easily
achieved like so:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin

<Sect2><Title>Add surface topography</Title>

<Para>Survex 1.2.18 added support for loading terrain data and rendering it as
a transparent surface.  Currently the main documentation for this is maintained
as a <ulink url="https://trac.survex.com/wiki/TerrainData">wiki page</ulink>
as this allows us to update it between releases.
</Para>

<Para>
We recommend using this new code in preference, but previously the simplest
approach was to generate a <filename>.svx</filename> file with the surface mesh
in and display it with the survey data.
</Para>

<Para>
It is possible to generate
a mesh or contours overlaying your area by various means.  NASA have made
1 arc-second (approximately 30m) terrain data available for the USA for
some years, with only 3 arc-second data available for other countries.
However, starting in 2014 they're gradually making 1 arc-second data
available for more countries.
</Para>

<Para>
If you want a better resolution that this, reading heights from the
contours on a map is one approach.  It's laborious, but feasible for
a small area.
</Para>

<Para>
Details of several methods are given in the BCRA Cave Surveying
Group magazine Compass Points issue 11, available online at
<ulink url="http://www.chaos.org.uk/survex/cp/CP11/CPoint11.htm#Art_5">http://www.chaos.org.uk/survex/cp/CP11/CPoint11.htm#Art_5</ulink>
</Para>

<Para>If you're using another program to generate a <filename>.svx</filename> file for the surface
mesh, it's best to use the NOSURVEY data style.
Simply fix all the grid intersections at the correct
coordinates and height, and put legs between them using the NOSURVEY style.
Here's a grid of 4 squares and 9 intersections:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*fix 00 000 000 1070

This is far simpler than trying to create fake tape/compass/clino legs of
the right length for each line in the mesh.  It's also very fast to process
with cavern.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Overlay a grid</Title>

<Para>Aven is able to display a grid, but this functionality isn't currently
available in printouts.
You can achieve a similar effect for now by creating a <filename>.svx</filename> file
where the survey legs form a grid.

<Sect2><Title>Import data from other programs</Title>

<Para><Application>Survex</Application> supports a number of features to help with importing
existing data. You can specify the ordering of items on a line using *Data
(see <Application>Survex</Application> Keywords above), and you can specify the characters used
to mean different things using *Set (see <Application>Survex</Application> Keywords above).
</Para>

<Para>The Ignore and Ignoreall options to the *Data command are often
particularly useful, e.g. if you have a dataset with LRUD info or comments
on the ends of lines.
</Para>

<Sect3><Title>Changing Meanings of Characters</Title>

<Para>e.g. if you have some data with station names containing the 
characters '?' and '+' (which are not permitted in a name by default)
then the command:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*SET NAMES ?+</programlisting>

<Para>
specifies that question marks and plus signs are permitted in station names.
A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 are always permitted. '_' and '-' are also permitted by
default, but aren't in this example.
</Para>

<Para>If your data uses a comma ',' instead of a decimal point, then
you use
</Para>

<programlisting>
*SET DECIMAL ,</programlisting>

<Para>to specify that ',' is now the decimal separator instead of '.'.
</Para>

<!-- FIXME
<Para>Note that there are plenty of ways you can use this facility to
completely confuse the software, as it may not be able to work out what is
going on, or it may simply be ambiguous. It can cope with some ambiguity (e.g.
the '-' character is used both for 'MINUS' and for 'OMIT'), but there are
limits. If you have a dataset that you can not make <Application>Survex</Application>
understand, then send it to us, and we will see what can be done.
